md5-simd
========
An md5 implementation using **SSE/AVX** instructions.

Built from an [existing md5 implementation](http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-md5-function).
Also some SIMD functions took from [https://github.com/crossbowerbt/md5/](https://github.com/crossbowerbt/md5/blob/master/md5_sse.c)
